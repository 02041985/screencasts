This program allows you to explore the world's cities.

 * Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.
 * Pan by dragging.
 * Hover over a city to get its name and population.

Each circle represents a city. Each filled in pixel of a circle represents 50,000 people. When city circles overlap, they appear brighter, so brightness can be interpreted as population density.

The data comes from [Geonames](https://github.com/curran/data/tree/gh-pages/geonames) and shows only cities with population >100,000.
