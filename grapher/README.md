## Tutorial Steps:

 * Creating and using a Canvas element
 * Drawing a sine wave path consisting of many lines
 * Transforming between math coordinates and pixel coordinates
 * Animation with requestAnimationFrame
 * Using Math.js to evaluate mathematical expressions
 * Plotting a Math.js expression
 * Using a TextField to drive the math expression
 * Using the URL hash fragment to store and share plots


On Tuesday 11/12/2013, we wrote the [basic function plotter](http://jsbin.com/UriGaQo/4/edit).

On Thursday 11/14/2013, we completed the core functionality of the graphing 
calculator.

 * Here's the [Code in JSBin](http://jsbin.com/UriGaQo/80/edit)
 * Here's a cleaned up and thoroughly documented version of the code:
   * [run it](http://curran.github.io/screencasts/grapher/grapher.html)
   * [grapher.html source code](grapher.html)
   * [grapher.js source code](js.html)

Please use the `grapher.html` and `grapher.js` as the starting point for the 
[assignment](http://curran.github.io/screencasts/grapher/assignment.pdf).
