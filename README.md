This repository contains code that goes along with [my screencasts](http://www.youtube.com/user/currankelleher/videos).

Here's a suggested sequence progressing in complexity:

 * Introduction to Computer Programming in JavaScript - [screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpA8k167gU) - [code](https://github.com/curran/screencasts/tree/gh-pages/introToJS) - Introduces basic syntax and semantics of the JavaScript Language.
 * Mathematical Graphic Patterns - [screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8SaZtTctKQ) - [code](https://github.com/curran/screencasts/tree/gh-pages/mathPatterns) - Introduces HTML5 Canvas and animation.
 * Bouncing Circles - [screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0T7lviBnY&feature=youtu.be) - [code](https://github.com/curran/screencasts/tree/gh-pages/bouncingCircles) - Covers interaction with HTML5 canvas and n-body physics simulation.
 * Polygon Editor with HTML5 Canvas, Backbone.js and Require.js - [screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNfKn0wbxYI) - [code](https://github.com/curran/screencasts/tree/gh-pages/polygonEditor) - Introduces the Model View Controller concept along with Require.js, Underscore.js, and Backbone.js by building an interactive polygon editor.
 * Building a Graphing Calculator - [screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-_Lc6FrDRw&feature=youtu.be&a) - [code](https://github.com/curran/screencasts/tree/gh-pages/grapher) - Covers plotting of mathematical functions, linking user interface elements to a model behind the graphics, and using the URL hash fragment (without any single-page-app libraries).
 * Introduction to Angular.js in 50 examples - [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRrL5j3MIvo&feature=youtu.be) - [code](https://github.com/curran/screencasts/tree/gh-pages/introToAngular) - Introduces Angular.js, covers background of data binding, single-page-apps, and related libraries, then introduces Angular features by example.
