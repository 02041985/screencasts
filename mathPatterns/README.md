The code from an ["Mathematical Patterns" tutorial](http://todo-add-youtube-link) given at MIT on July 28, 2013. Part of the [HSSP 2013](http://curransoft.com/interactivegraphics/?p=485) course [Computer Programming and Interactive Graphics](http://curransoft.com/interactivegraphics/?p=485).

[Play with the code in JSBin](http://jsbin.com/urecex/31/edit)!

Here's the [starter code](http://jsbin.com/edifap/4/edit) you can use to follow along (also [in GitHub](starter)).

Content of the tutorial:

 * Nested for loops
 * The m by n matrix concept
 * Declaring many variables in one statement
 * Strategies for writing code: first write the overall structure, then fill in details
 * Drawing a grid of circles
   * Computing (x, y) from (i, j)
   * Drawing circles with the HTML5 Canvas API
 * requestAnimationFrame
   * Why requestAnimationFrame is better than setInterval
 * Alternative syntax for function definition
   * `var draw = function(){}` vs. `function draw(){}`
 * Introducing a `time` variable
 * Defining animated parametric (x, y) patterns based on (u, v)
 * Assigning size as a function of (u, v, time)
 * Using JSBin to publish your programs in comments
 * Using stroke to draw outlines
 * Setting the color to be a function of size
